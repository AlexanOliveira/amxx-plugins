## AmxModX Plugins â€” Counter-Strike 1.6

Some of my **amxx** private plugins that I wrote or rewrote (improved). Most of them are for **Surf Mod**.

I made them for my Server:
Death Bringer # Server [Surf / HNS / KZ] IP: **177.54.151.114:27020**

The **.sma** files are the source code, need to be compiled to become **.amxx**

<br>

### How to Install:

Plugin example: **db_fps_limiter.amxx**

Go to `addons/amxmodx/configs/` and wrote **db_fps_limiter.amxx** in `plugins.ini` file

Now place the file **db_fps_limiter.amxx**  in `addons/amxmodx/plugins` folder.

Restart the server or change the map to update plugins.
